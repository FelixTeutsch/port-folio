                        One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his
                        bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little
                        he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The
                        bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs,

                        "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a
                        little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile
                        samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung
                        a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded
                        frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy
                        fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look
                        out the window at the dull weather. [...]
