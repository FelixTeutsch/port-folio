                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Felix Teutsch, I'm 21 years old and come from Italy. I started coding in year 8.
                    In
                    the
                    past years, I have acquired some knowledge in a variety of different coding languages.

        <div class="section">
            <div class="text">
                <h2>HTML / CSS / JS</h2>
                <p>My coding journey starts with an old time classic, the basic web development kit.
                    This passion was sparked in me by my half brother, who gifted me my first Raspberry Pi with a fully
                    operational web server.
                    The following years I created smaller websites, with different objectives:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shops, to explore the world of product-based websites</li>
                    <li>Wiki's, to explore the world of knowledge base websites</li>
                    <li>Presentations, to see if a well-created website could be an alternative to a PowerPoint</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the beginning, my websites were halfway between functional and broken CSS but most of the time it
                    all worked out. Alongside HTML and CSS, I often created small features in CSS and implemented them
                    as to my best abilities. Without prior coding knowledge, this often turned out to be much harder
                    then I had hoped.

                <h2>Java</h2>
                <p>
                    Java will always hold a special place in my heart. A powerful, semi-modern programming language that
                    gives people the ability to code Minecraft plugins. As you might have guessed, that's how I started
                    to code in Java. I developed plugins for my Minecraft server. What started with simple item
                    manipulation, quickly evolved into a full-blown Inventory menu, navigable by clicking on different
                    items. This was when I first saw the power of programming. My little knowledge of Java gave me the
                    ability to bring my craziest thoughts to life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My self-learned java knowledge proved very usefully. Not only when learning C# in school, but also
                    when beginning to code in Java during my first two years of university.

                <h2>C#</h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first coding language I learned in school. What started as simple console applications
                    quickly evolved into complex form applications. Around this time, I also started designing and
                    incorporated my newly found passion for visuals into my ability to code. This resulted in programs
                    with great features and creative designs.

                <p>
                    Let's get one thing clear. SQL is pronounced S.Q.L. and not sequel! Having that
                    clear, we can dive into my experience with Databases and their integration via PHP. I learned this
                    during my final year of high school. An example of something I created at the time can be found
                    here:

                <p>
                    These last languages are all self self-learned. I used them to realise some smaller personal but
                    also some big university projects:
